**MultiStompController** - a compact MIDI converter that receives MIDI data from the MOEN GEC5 loop switcher (or other MIDI sources) and translates it into separate MIDI outputs for the Zoom MS-50G Multistomp (via MIDI-USB) and the Strymon Iridium or any other MIDI device (via MIDI-EXP).


Resources used:

- Arduino Nano v4 compatible
    https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/arduino-compatable-nano-v4


- USBHost v2.4 (preloaded with MIDI Device firmware)
    https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host-board-v24


- MIDI breakout board

- DPDT momentary switches for "Tuner" and "Update Patch" functions


Arduino libraries used:
- AltSoftSerial (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html)

- SoftwareSerial



Wiring instructions:

- Connect [VIN, GND] of Arduino to 9V DC (careful, center negative).

- Connect [5V, GND] on USBHost and MIDI breakout board to [5V, GND] on Arduino.

- Connect RX on USBHost to D02 (Pin 5) on Arduino (SoftwareSerial TX).

- Connect TX on USBHost to D03 (Pin 6) on Arduino (SoftwareSerial RX).

- Connect MIDI In on MIDI breakout board to D09 (Pin 12) on Arduino (AltSoftSerial RX).

- Connect MIDI Out on MIDI breakout board to D08 (Pin 11) on Arduino (AltSoftSerial TX).

- Connect DPDT "Tuner" switch to [A0, GND] on Arduino.

- Connect DPDT "Update Patch" switch to [A1, GND] on Arduino.



Connection instructions:

- Connect MIDI In to the MOEN GEC5 loop switcher (or other).

- Connect MIDI Out to the Strymon Iridium (or other).

- Connect USBHost to the Zoom Multistomp.



Customization / adaptation notes for other setups:

- MultistompController.ino contains the main program flow.

- MIDI In is collected via a static MidiBuffer, which feeds input to the Controllers.

- The main controller classes MidiController and ZoomController derive from the Controller class and define the output/through logic of the corresponding devices (i.e. how inputs are converted to outputs or passed through).

- These controllers must implement the events OnReceiveCC, OnReceivePC and OnResetCtrl. They may also override the default methods Update, OnSend and Reset.
